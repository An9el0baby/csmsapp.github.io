## 录取偏好

喜欢有art背景的学生，"look for both a strong CS background and a portfolio of your work"  "We are looking to see how you are able to combine the two and understand how that might lead to the work you would do here at Dartmouth."

portfolio重中之重，一定要认真准备

Code Sample要求："Something that shows your graphics coding skills, or some code related to visual computing, is ideal, but if you don't have that,  good clean, well commented code, not from a class, but from a research or other development project is best."

## 项目特点

以下为项目负责人邮件回复的原文

"The MS in CS with a concentration in Digital Arts (we call it the MSDA) and the regular MS program are both 2 year programs (six terms).  Every student in the MSDA do a research project (3 terms of courses and 3 terms of research) that can range from something like what a PhD student might work on (research in graphics, physical computing, rendering, ML, robotics, HCI) or it could look more like an art project that incorporates new technologies (AR/VR, interactive art).  All students in the MSDA program take a reading course in their first winter term in which they learn how to read a research paper, do some prior work research, and learn about the areas of study of faculty in field related to the MSDA program.  Most of the MS students who work with graphics faculty are in the MSDA program, but it is possible for students in the regular MS program to also do research and work in graphics.  In other words, it would be possible to do much the same work in either program, but the MSDA would require you to do research where the MSCS would allow you to either do all courses or courses plus research."
